## Learning Activities and Resources  
This week, I systematically studied the core features of Sass through practicing a customized Sass website project, and optimized the development process in combination with the Gulp build tool. Firstly, I set up the project structure, wrote the `style.scss` file that includes variables, nesting, mixins, and extension/inheritance, and configured Gulp to achieve automatic compilation and compression of CSS.  

**Learning Resources:**  
- [Sass Syntax Tutorial](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sass-essential-training-15630917/sass-syntax?autoplay=true&trk=learning-course_tocItem&upsellOrderOrigin=default_guest_learning)  
- [Sass Interpolation Tutorial](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sass-essential-training-15630917/interpolation?autoplay=true&trk=learning-course_tocItem&upsellOrderOrigin=default_guest_learning)  


## Estimated Hours  
This week, I spent approximately **3 hours** on this issue, which does not include the time I spent on my assignments.  


## Insights on Content  
Through practice, I have deeply realized the improvement of Sass on the efficiency of style development:  
1. **Variables** unify the basic attributes of the website such as colors and fonts. When making modifications, only one place needs to be adjusted, avoiding the cumbersome global search and replacement.  
2. **Nesting** makes the CSS rules highly match the HTML structure, reducing the repeated writing of selectors and significantly enhancing the code readability.  
3. **Mixins** encapsulate cross-browser compatibility code (such as `border-radius`), achieving a balance between code reuse and flexibility through parameterization.  
4. **Extension/Inheritance** eliminates duplicate styles through the placeholder class (`%button-base`), and at the same time allows for local customization (such as the button hover effect), maintaining the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle of the code.  


## Professional/Employability/Learning Insights  
I have indeed gained something from what I didn’t master during the practice, such as learning about the more complex application of custom functions in Sass and the more efficient file listening and error handling mechanisms in Gulp. These pieces of knowledge that I haven’t been exposed to during this practice are extremely valuable to me. I think these newly learned contents will be very useful when developing large-scale website projects in the future. For example, the custom functions of Sass can make the logic of the style code more flexible and handle more complex style calculations; and the optimized file listening and error handling mechanisms of Gulp can greatly improve the development efficiency, reduce unnecessary debugging time, and enable me to focus more on the design and implementation of the website styles. Judging from this week’s learning strategy, I have concluded that this learning method of "practice + theoretical supplementation" is effective.
