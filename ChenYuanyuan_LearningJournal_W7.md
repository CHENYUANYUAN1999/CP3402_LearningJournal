# Learning Activities and Resources
This week, I built a user registration/login system using PHP and MySQL. After completing the hands-on implementation, I studied LinkedIn Learning courses *PHP Basics* and *MySQL Database Design*. I also referenced the official PHP documentation and W3Schools SQL tutorials to solidify core principles of database interaction. These resources significantly enhanced my understanding of permission management mechanisms in user systems.

## Estimated Hours
Approximately 6 hours were spent on this project this week.

## Content Insights
- Gained practical mastery of PHP session control (`session_start()`) and password hashing (`password_hash()`) through hands-on implementation
- Understood how `if/else` statements dynamically render different content based on user roles when implementing admin permissions
- Recognized the importance of code modularity through `include` statements for reusable header/footer components, which shares similarities with Java's object-oriented programming concepts

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- Complemented project work with LinkedIn Learning modules on PHP prepared statements and SQL injection protection, critical security practices in real-world development
- Discovered parallels between PHP array handling (e.g., `$_SESSION`) and Java's collection classes, accelerating my learning curve
- Plan to explore the Laravel framework to improve development efficiency
- Found the "practice-course-repractice" learning cycle highly effective, particularly in building documentation查阅能力 when troubleshooting database connection issues
